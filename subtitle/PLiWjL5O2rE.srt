Sounds like friction is something you're very familiar

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,960
with. I just it's a word just as

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,665
I feel like it's like Yes. Cast above

4
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:10,985
us right now in bold face, highlighted, underlined

5
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:13,225
letters. He's just like is growing. Friction. Yes.

6
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,465
Like, you're you're up in the morning, and

7
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,850
I imagine David Goggins going to the coffee

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,730
maker, stretching out. Good morning, sunshine. And you're

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,925
telling me from eyelids open Mhmm. There's friction.

10
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,685
Yes. And that is the thing that people

11
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:30,465
don't they don't fucking get. The biggest misunderstand

12
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,430
about David Goggins of all time. It's like

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,110
whether you believe in god or not, I

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,790
do. He put this lab rat, which is

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,455
me, on this planet. And so let me

16
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:46,475
fucking see what a beat up, abused kid

17
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:49,915
who has who can barely learn, barely learn,

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,000
Who has a twisted body, messed up messed

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,680
up genetics, sickle cell this and that. Let

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,495
me give him everything that Pretty much disqualifies

21
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:02,435
you from the military. But back then, it

22
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,355
wasn't extras. And and let's put them in

23
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,695
this and see what comes out of it.

24
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,920
So to do that, Friction. You don't wake

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
up in the morning time and go to

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,280
the coffeemaker. Matter of fact, sometimes you don't

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,825
even sleep. What it requires It's when I'm

28
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,185
at 2 o'clock in the it's 2 o'clock

29
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:20,585
in the morning, and my brain is thinking

30
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:23,145
about a fucking drug. And I gotta get

31
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,760
up and look in my book To see

32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,340
what that drug is how I remember it.

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,000
And this is every day of my fucking

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,780
life. That's why when I train a fighter

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,745
or I train some I'm like, You have

36
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,685
no fucking idea how great you really are

37
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:42,345
because you are using such minimal minimal of

38
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:45,490
what you have. And if people can learn

39
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,250
to focus, this is what's possible. While it

40
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,930
may not be pretty, like, people wanna do

41
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,955
a documentary on me. I go, no. I

42
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:56,995
want to do documentary army because I will

43
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:00,755
have normal everyday people picking me apart. His

44
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,720
life is miserable. Who wants to live like

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,600
that? He looks it's crazy how he it's

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,945
almost like he's sick. He's psychotic. The most

47
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:14,025
frustrating thing in the world for me is

48
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:17,005
when normal people judge a man like myself

49
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:22,720
on what it really takes to extract Greatness

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,380
from nothing. It takes every bit of who

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,515
you are if you choose that route. If

52
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,635
you don't, Merry Christmas. Do what you gotta

53
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:35,855
do. But, yeah, all these things for me,

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,780
Like like I told you, man. I'm a

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,020
I'm a keep it real. I I'm not

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,680
coming here to talk about, like, you know,

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,815
perform without purpose. Because I go through when

58
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,215
I write these books, I go through and

59
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:52,550
try to dumb down David Goggins. How can

60
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,750
I give normal people not normal, but I

61
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,310
found something that most don't wanna find? How

62
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,070
can I speak to people and give them

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,535
something from this Crazy psychotic brain that I've

64
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,535
developed? How can I give him that? So

65
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,575
I sit down with Jennifer for years and

66
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:12,720
write down, Perform without purpose. Callous your mind.

67
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,720
Armor your mind. The cookie jar. The accountability

68
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,165
mirror. Shit that people can fucking use in

69
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,925
their lives. No. No. I'm glad it helps

70
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:27,560
you, But the barbaric life that I live,

71
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,000
that you have to live, the almost obsession

72
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,415
that you must have to be great, You

73
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,935
can't put that shit in a fucking book,

74
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:37,275
bro. You can't put it in a book.

75
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,815
You can't. You can't write about it. It

76
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:41,335
has to be experienced. It has to be

77
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:44,610
experienced. And you can't even after you experience

78
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,210
it, to write it in the book, it

79
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,295
would seem like He needs to be locked

80
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,675
up. This way. Too gory. It's it's too

81
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,195
gory. It doesn't make sense for a guy

82
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:57,860
that everything every second of the day, He

83
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,520
is trying to extract more from something. He's

84
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,020
constantly thinking. He's constantly constantly disciplined, never going

85
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,205
off the path. Whatever is injured on him,

86
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:12,505
he figures a way. It's a conqueror's mindset,

87
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:18,080
and very few people, if any, Can't really

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,020
understand what that is. Like, I'm almost 50,

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
and I've been this way for almost 30

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,605
years. Like, what do you do for fun?

91
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,765
You you would never I I I these

92
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:31,525
questions, I don't I don't get them. I

93
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,220
don't understand them. I don't. So yeah. I

94
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,820
get asked that sometimes when you, for fun,

95
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,660
start listening off all this stuff like podcast

96
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,140
and reading Right. Or working out. Right. But

97
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,615
So some of that resonates, but I think

98
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:47,035
what's so truly unusual about what you're describing,

99
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:51,310
your process, is that, You know, from go,

100
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,450
it's hard. Yep. And I have to ask

101
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,485
was being Â£300 having ascent. I'm using the

102
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,725
words you've described. Do it. You've said it

103
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:01,645
before. Mhmm. You had a tendency at one

104
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,885
point in your life early on, tell lies.

105
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,285
Yep. Try and get people's approval. My ass

106
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:11,260
off. Crazy haircuts, attention seeking, and and yet

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,155
all of that triggered something Mhmm. That now

108
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:20,295
is, you know, is extraordinary. Right. Do you

109
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:24,550
think those hardships were necessary to flip the

110
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,970
switch. I don't know if they were necessary,

111
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,090
but it was something that made me feel

112
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:36,115
I didn't feel good. It was easy. The

113
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,455
brain that I was given as a child,

114
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,950
It was easy to go home and think

115
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,550
about what how do I wanna be a

116
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,030
freak today? How do I wanna show up

117
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,845
to school today and be a freak? It

118
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,605
didn't require me going home and open a

119
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:51,405
book up saying, it's gonna take me all

120
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:54,125
year to learn this fucking page. So instead

121
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,360
of learning that page, I learned how to

122
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,180
become a character. And maybe that character that

123
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,855
I created, that 300 pound Insecure guy that

124
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,035
used to fake fake it till I make

125
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:10,935
it type of guy, you know, let me,

126
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,775
become your friend. Let me lie to you

127
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,800
until you like me type of guy. When

128
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,260
when you have any kind of any manhood,

129
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,640
womanhood, a human being, a soul, a spirit,

130
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,925
any, I had no I had I must

131
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:29,205
had just this much pride because that's exactly

132
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,205
what opened the door for me. Because every

133
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,885
day you were a character, every day you

134
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:36,170
were a clown, every day You open that

135
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,030
Spanish book or that science book or English

136
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,230
book, you like you looked at it, it

137
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,290
was like it looked like a foreign language.

138
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:47,115
And you're saying, where do I start? Where

139
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:51,640
who do I start? And obviously, sir. The

140
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,080
more I talk about it, it wasn't necessary

141
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,240
because what happened is I became haunted by

142
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,420
the mere fact that this is my existence,

143
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:03,395
And you gotta live with that. I lived

144
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:05,235
with it for a lot of years. And

145
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,975
so I sat back and said, okay. Alright.

146
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
I know what this takes. And when you

147
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,720
sit back, as fucked up as I was,

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,005
and I had a laundry list, a A

149
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,165
a table like this of what I have

150
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,505
to do to become just a human being

151
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,870
that can make ends meet, That can make

152
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,590
$1,000 a month just to get there. I

153
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,510
was like, oh my god, dude. Like, how

154
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,465
did I'm 16, 17. I can't read. I

155
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:37,225
can't write. And I oh my God. I'm

156
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,985
so behind the power curve, and my brain

157
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:41,380
is about Being depressed and my dad beat

158
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,860
my mom's not home, and kids are calling

159
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,460
me nigger at school. And I'm like, oh

160
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,060
my god, man. What the fuck do I

161
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,465
do? And it wasn't like someone came around

162
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:53,445
and said, hey, man. You can do this.

163
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:56,865
This is all me. Some people know where

164
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:59,420
is this cold man come from. I'm not

165
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,620
trying to be cold. It's the reality of

166
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
my life. It's the reality of a lot

167
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,915
of people's lives. And so yeah. That had

168
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:11,235
to happen for me to be haunted, to

169
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,315
be haunted, to pull out, to extract the

170
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:17,460
goddamn today. That haunting It's something that's still

171
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,020
there today. Because no matter how much you

172
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,500
improve, no matter how much you change who

173
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,855
you are, it's not permanent. You'll just wake

174
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,275
up and say, oh my god, man. You're

175
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,455
you're David Goggins. You break records. You do

176
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,510
this. You do that. People don't know. How

177
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,370
are you how are you able to just

178
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,870
be so hard? Can I never turn the

179
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,835
fucking thing off? Because once it turns off,

180
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:45,795
I go right back to the David Goggins

181
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:48,275
that is, and that's the guy that I'm

182
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:51,255
constantly fighting every day. And it's a choice,

183
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,550
And that choice makes you misunderstood. It makes

184
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,430
you crazy. That's why I hate fucking social

185
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,745
media. In 2013, People want me to write

186
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:04,545
my book. I did it in 2018. Took

187
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,945
5 years. And the reason why I didn't

188
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:09,000
do it, I set a table and Jennifer

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,400
was there. It's before I I I she

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
started working for me. I started dating her,

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,915
whatever. And all these people were there, And

192
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:17,435
they're like, man, you gotta go on social

193
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:20,095
media. And I was like, fuck you, man.

194
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,495
Like, I'm not that that's it's it's poison.

195
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,840
It's poison because I knew what I did

196
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,820
to get where I am, and I'm gonna

197
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,240
have these people, these normal everyday people, fat,

198
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:37,065
Lazy is exactly who I was judging me

199
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,685
because I know it because I was once

200
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:42,470
them. All my hard work, all my dedication,

201
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,870
I'm a have some normal dude get his

202
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,530
little brownies, little ding dong, ho ho twinkie,

203
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:51,385
Sit there with this coffee picking me apart.

204
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:54,085
Oh, he must be unhappy. He's just do

205
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,630
you know How hard is to put these

206
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,390
shoes on every damn morning? I don't have

207
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,815
you pick me apart? So, yeah, There's there's,

208
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:07,415
there's so much that goes into this that

209
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:09,975
I was like, fuck this. I never want

210
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:10,950
anything to do with it.
