An ability to control your levels of stress

2
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,005
in real time is extremely powerful. It turns

3
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,565
out you can do this using physiology and

4
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,460
neuroscience. Your breathing can directly impact your heart

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,200
rate and your level of stress or calm.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,855
Here's how it works. When you inhale, your

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:31,455
diaphragm moves down. This creates more space in

8
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,175
your thoracic cavity, and your heart actually gets

9
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,750
a little bit bigger. As a consequence, the

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,910
rate of blood flow through that larger heart

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,510
volume slows down. A signal is sent from

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,315
a group of neurons on your heart called

13
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:47,195
the sinoatrial node. That signal goes up to

14
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,595
the brain, and your brain sends a signal

15
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:52,175
to speed the heart up. In other words,

16
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:56,090
inhaling speeds your heart rate up. The opposite

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,570
is true as well. When you exhale, your

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,435
diaphragm moves up. Your heart gets a little

19
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,275
bit smaller because there's a little bit less

20
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,175
space in your thoracic cavity. As a consequence,

21
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:09,055
blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume.

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,310
The sinoatrial node registers that and sends a

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,710
signal to your brain, and the brain sends

24
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,455
a signal to slow the heart down. So

25
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:19,775
in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate

26
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:22,815
up, exhaling slows your heart rate down. So

27
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,255
if you want to speed up your heart

28
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,560
rate and be more alert, Inhale more or

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,640
make those inhales more vigorous, more intense. If

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,075
you wanna calm down, You can do that

31
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:36,635
quickly by making your exhale slightly longer than

32
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:39,995
your inhales or making them more vigorous. This

33
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:41,915
doesn't require any breath work. This is something

34
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,290
that you can do in real time. And

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,050
that's what's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That's the

36
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,370
technical phrase. It's also the basis of what's

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,575
called heart rate variability or HRV. But all

38
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:56,295
you need to remember is inhaling deeper and

39
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:59,035
longer will speed your heart rate up. Exhaling

40
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,730
Longer and more intensely will slow your heart

41
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,410
rate down and will allow you to calm

42
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,310
down in
